🎮 Math for Game Development

This repository contains my personal studies and code experiments related to math for game development.

The goal of this project is to build a strong mathematical foundation for games, focusing on concepts that are commonly used in areas such as:

game AI

movement and physics

steering behaviors

spatial reasoning

gameplay systems

All examples are implemented in code to reinforce practical understanding, not just theory.

📌 What This Repository Is About

This repo is a learning notebook in code form.

Each folder or file represents:

a math concept (vectors, magnitude, normalization, etc.)

a small experiment

or a code example inspired by a lesson

The focus is on:

understanding why the math works

understanding how it is used in games

writing simple, readable code to represent each idea

This repository will grow over time as new topics are studied.

🧠 Topics Covered (and planned)

Some of the concepts explored in this repository include:

Points vs vectors

Vector addition and subtraction

Vector magnitude and normalization

Direction and distance between objects

Basic math used in game AI

Applying math concepts to real gameplay scenarios

More advanced topics will be added as the studies progress.

🎓 Learning Source
